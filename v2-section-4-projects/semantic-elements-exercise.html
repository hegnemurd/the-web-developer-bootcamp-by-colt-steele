        <p>
          The <b>cat</b> (Felis catus) is a <em>domestic species</em> of small
          <em>carnivorous mammal.</em><sup>[1][2]</sup>It is the only
          domesticated species in the family <em>Felidae</em> and is often
          referred to as the <b>domestic cat</b> to distinguish it from the wild
          members of the family.<sup>[4]</sup>A cat can either be a
          <b>house cat</b>, a <em>farm cat</em> or a <em>feral cat;</em> the
          latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.<sup>[5]</sup>Domestic
          cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt
          <em>rodents</em>. About 60 <em>cat breeds</em> are recognized by
          various <em>cat registries.</em><sup>[6]</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
          The cat is similar in <em>anatomy</em> to the other felid species: it
          has a strong flexible body, quick <em>reflexes</em>, sharp teeth and
          <em>retractable claws</em> adapted to killing small prey. Its
          <em>night vision</em> and sense of smell are well developed.
          <em>Cat communication</em> includes <em>vocalizations</em> like
          <em>meowing, purring, trilling,</em> hissing, <em>growling</em> and
          grunting as well as <em>cat-specific body language.</em> A
          <em>predator</em> that is most active at dawn and dusk, the cat is a
          solitary hunter but a <em>social species.</em> It can hear sounds too
          faint or too high in <em>frequency</em> for human ears, such as those
          made by <em>mice</em> and other small mammals.<sup>[7]</sup> It
          secretes and perceives <em>pheromones</em>.<sup>[8]</sup>

          Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with
          litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.<sup>[9]</sup>
          Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered
          <em>pedigreed cats</em>, a hobby known as <em>cat fancy</em>. Failure
          to control breeding of <em>pet</em> cats by <em>spaying</em> and
          <em>neutering</em>, as well as abandonment of pets, resulted in large
          numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of
          entire bird, mammal, and reptile species, and evoking
          <em>population control.</em><sup>[10]</sup>

        <p>
          Cats were first domesticated in the <em>Near East</em> around 7500
          BC.<sup>[11]</sup> It was long thought that cat domestication was
          initiated in <em>ancient Egypt</em>, as since around 3100 BC
          veneration was given to <em>cats in ancient Egypt.</em
          ><sup>[12][13]</sup> As of <time>2017</time>, the domestic cat was the
          second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats
          owned.<sup>[14][15][16]</sup> In the United Kingdom, around 7.3
          million cats lived in more than 4.8 million households as of 2019.<sup
